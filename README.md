Architecture
Models: 
Define the structure of the database tables for Clinics, Doctors, Patients, Visits, and Appointments.
Views:
Handles the logic for rendering templates and processing user input. Include class-based views (e.g., ListView, DetailView) and function-based views for specific tasks.
Templates:
HTML files that define the structure of the web pages. Use Django template language to display data dynamically.
URLs:
Route incoming requests to the appropriate view functions or classes. Separate URL configurations for app-specific routes and API endpoints.
API:
Provides endpoints for CRUD operations on Clinics, Doctors, Patients, Visits, and Appointments. Uses serializers to convert complex data types into JSON.
Admin Interface:
Utilizes Django's built-in admin panel to manage data directly.
Static Files:
This includes CSS and JavaScript files that Django serves during development.






Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/NaitikR/dental_management_system.git

3. Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Configure PostgreSQL:
Enter Postgres and create a database and a user for the database and grant user access.
psql postgres
CREATE DATABASE dental_management_db;
CREATE USER ‘username’ WITH PASSWORD ‘your_password’;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE dental_management_db TO ‘username’;
Exit postgres by:
\q
5. Update dental/settings.py with above database and user details:
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'dental_management_db',
        'USER': 'your_username',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}

6. Run Migrations:
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
7. Create Superuser:
python manage.py createsuperuser
#You will be prompted to enter a username, email address, and password. For example:
#Username: adminuser
#Email: adminuser@dentalproject.com
#Password: [Enter a secure password]

8. Run the Server:
python manage.py runserver
9. Access the Application:
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ to log in as admin and add sample data.
10. Adding Sample Data
Log in to Admin Interface: Use the superuser credentials.
Add Data: Add clinics, doctors, and patients using the admin interface.
11. Check individual pages of clinics, patients, and doctors by using the  ‘View Site’ option on the top right.
You can see lists of the added data, view them, edit them, and add new data from here too.
12. For the REST APIs usage:
I used Postman to check for different API requests, examples of which are given below.


REST API Endpoints:

Add Patient
Request Method: POST
URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/patients/
Body (JSON):
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "date_of_birth": "1990-01-01",
  "address": "123 Main St",
  "phone_number": "1234567890",
  "ssn_last_4": "1234",
  "gender": "M"
}

Add Doctor
Method: POST
URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/doctors/
Body (JSON):
{
  "npi": "1234567890",
  "name": "Dr. Smith",
  "email": "dr.smith@example.com",
  "phone_number": "0987654321",
  "specialties": ["Cleaning", "Filling"]
}

Add Clinic
Method: POST
URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/clinics/
Body (JSON):
{
  "name": "Downtown Clinic",
  "phone_number": "1231231234",
  "email": "contact@downtownclinic.com",

  "state": "NY"
}

Get Clinic Information
Method: GET
URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/clinics/
#this will give the list of all the clinics with their ids, then you can request individual clinics using id:
URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/clinics/<id>/

Assumptions Made:
The user interface is intuitive for administrative users.
Clinics must have at least one doctor to offer procedures.
Procedures are predefined and linked to doctor specialties.
